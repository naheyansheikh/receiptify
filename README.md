# Receiptify üßæ

## Overview
Receiptify is a web application that generates stylized receipts based on a user's Spotify listening history. It provides a unique way to visualize your favorite tracks and artists over different periods such as the last month, the last six months, or all time. The application connects with Spotify, allowing users to authenticate and fetch their listening data directly through Spotify's API.
